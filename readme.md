# 💼 Job Salary Predictor

A machine learning project that predicts salary based on a candidate's **job title** and **years of experience**.  
The model is trained using Excel data, preprocessed, and then used to generate salary predictions.

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Job Salary Predictor** uses a trained ML model to estimate a person's salary using:

- Job Title
- Years of Experience

The model was built by:
1. Loading salary data from an dataset
2. Cleaning and preprocessing the data
3. Training a machine learning model
4. Predicting salary based on user inputs
